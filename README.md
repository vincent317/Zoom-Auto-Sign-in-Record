     <br /> **Note.** If your meeting has a password, type Fpassword (ex. F123); if not, type Tpassword (ex. T123).
     <br /> **Note.** For class time & class length, leave two/three minutes space. (ex. If your meeting is 8:00-12:00, use 7:58-12:01). <br /> <br /> 
  4. Click All Set button. <br /> <br /> 
  5. Enjoy your sleep! Your class will be automatically recorded in Captura's default save path. 
     <br /> **Note.** Do not move your mouse after clicking all set button.
